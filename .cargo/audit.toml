# RUSTSEC-2023-0071: rsa timing sidechannel - pulled in by sqlx-mysql which is
# unconditionally included in sqlx's published crate even when mysql feature is
# disabled. We only use SQLite and PostgreSQL, so this is a false positive.
#
# RUSTSEC-2026-0002: lru IterMut unsoundness - pulled in by tantivy for search.
# We don't use IterMut on the LRU cache directly; tantivy uses it internally.
# Monitor for tantivy to update their lru dependency.
