# Naked Pineapple Brand Identity Guide

A comprehensive guide to the Naked Pineapple brand aesthetic, design system, and implementation details.

---

## Brand Overview

**Brand Name:** Naked Pineapple
**Founder:** Kristi Fry — Licensed master aesthetician with 20+ years experience
**Contact:** info@nakedpineapple.co

**Mission:** Empower individuals to feel radiant, confident, and authentically themselves through pineapple-powered skincare. More than products—an experience of abundance, light, and love.

**Target Audience:** Anyone seeking authentic self-care — all genders, ages, races, body types, and backgrounds. United by confidence, authenticity, adventurous spirits, and a belief that self-care is self-love.

---

## Origin Story

Naked Pineapple was born in Hawaii, a place filled with incredible energy and magic. "Pineapple" became Kristi and her husband Ryan's code word—a loving reminder to reconnect when life felt overwhelming. In a serendipitous twist, Kristi discovered that pineapple itself—a symbol of hospitality and warmth—holds amazing skincare benefits.

The name "Naked" comes from the concept of "naked truths"—celebrating confidence in bare, natural skin, our most honest selves. The logo was originally drawn on a napkin, and each product has been meticulously formulated with ingredients designed to bring radiance and care.

**The Pineapple Metaphor:** "Just like a pineapple takes time to grow, your glow is a journey." The pineapple's crown represents standing tall, radiating confidence, and always wearing your crown.
